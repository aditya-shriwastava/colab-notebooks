1. [Object Detection](./Object%20Detection/index.md)

## Roadmap (Play with torchvision)
Play with different datasets, pretrained models etc for the task of:
1. Image classification
2. Object detection
3. Semantic Segmentation
4. Instance Segmentation

## torchvision
1. Data pipeline for all the popular image dataset, for tasks like:
  1.1. Image Classification
  1.2. Semantic Segmentation
  1.3. Object Detection
  1.4. Instance Segmentation
  1.5. Person keypoint detection
  1.6. Video Classification
2. Popular models and it's state_dict pretrained.
3. Image and Video IO
4. Feature extraction
5. Implementations of operations that are specific to Computer Vision
6. Implementation of common Image transformation
7. Different Image utilities
